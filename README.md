## About

![App logo](http://milikhin.name/img/tickets.png?)

Search airline tickets on Ubuntu Touch.

The app relies on the travelpayouts API and consists of two major parts:

* native UI (QML) to set up search filters 
* slightly optimized search results web frontend (jetradar.com)

## Development status
This is a work-in-progress app in an early stage of development. Expect things to be broken :)

Your feedback and feature requests are very appreciated.

## Known issues

* No internationalization yet
* No support for convergence yet
* Support for the dark theme is a WIP
